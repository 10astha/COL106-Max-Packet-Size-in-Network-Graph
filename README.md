Given the identities s and t of the source and the target router respectively, determination of  largest C such that a packet of size C can be transferred over the
network from s to t using priority queue and graphs
Let m denote the number of links in the network (the network is connected, that
is, it is possible to transfer a small enough packet from any node to any other node) 
Time complexity=O(m log m)
